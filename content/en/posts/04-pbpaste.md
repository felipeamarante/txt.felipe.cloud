### So you are following a long tutorial...

And you are getting bloody tired of copying and pasting all the YAMLs... urgh.  
What if I told you that **I can make your work 50% less painful?** Would you pay me a coffee? â˜•

Please refer to the YAML below  

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: definitely-not-prod
  labels:
    owner: "friday-5pm-dev"
spec:
  containers:
    - name: chaos-container
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "echo 'Deploying... just kidding!' && sleep 3600"]
      lifecycle:
        postStart:
          exec:
            command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Context set correctly?'"]
        preStop:
          exec:
            command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Goodbye, cruel cluster!'"]
  restartPolicy: Never
  nodeSelector:
    coffee-supply: "critical"
```

You can simply copy the YAML above and use `pbpaste` to pipe your clipboard through the `kubectl apply` with the command below:

```bash
pbpaste | k apply -f-
```

TadÃ¡! Works like a charm

Now be careful with what you copy ðŸ«¡
